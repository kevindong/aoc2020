# Advent of Code 2020
Keep in mind that I usually do these between 12am and 1am local time when I should probably be sleeping. I might spend a few moments polishing the code after I successfully solve the day's problem, but generally I'll push the code to Github within minutes of getting confirmation my answer is correct.

The code here is not necessarily what I'd consider to be good nor efficient code. 

## How to interpret my work
Each day gets its own folder. In general, each problem in each day gets its own file. Part 2 of each day generally builds off of part 1 in a way that you can use the same code to solve both parts. But frankly making code fit together cleanly is more effort than I'd like to expend at 1am so instead I just create two files: one for each part even if there's no refactoring required.

## Running Go files
For Go files, `cd` into the appropriate day's folder and run `go run <file>` (e.g. `cd day01 && go run day01p1.go`).
