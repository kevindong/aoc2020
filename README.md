# Advent of Code 2020
Keep in mind that I usually do these between 12am and 1am local time when I should probably be sleeping. I might spend a few moments polishing the code after I successfully solve the day's problem, but generally I'll push the code to Github within minutes of getting confirmation my answer is correct.

The code here is not necessarily what I'd consider to be good nor efficient code.
